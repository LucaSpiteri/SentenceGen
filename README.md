# Sentence Generator

This is a simple sentence generator I made in my free time.

## How to use:

1) Download sentencegen.py and sentencemodel.pickle.
2) Run `python3 sentencegen.py`
3) The program will prompt you to enter any word, the program will then generate a sentence starting with that word.
4) To quit the program, simply type `././` or press CTRL+C to force quit.

The sentencetrain.py file can be used to train a new model. This will generate or update the current sentencemodel.pickle file.
